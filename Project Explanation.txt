# **Cybersecurity Log Analysis Project – Step-by-Step Explanation**

---

### **Step 1: Define Project Goal**

**Objective**: Detect brute-force login attempts from authentication logs and report them with visualizations and geographic locations.

---

### **Step 2: Design the Data Schema**

Created a relational table in **PostgreSQL** called `auth_logs` with the following columns:

* `timestamp`
* `username`
* `ip_address`
* `user_agent`
* `login_result`
* `auth_method`
* `location` (optional or for enrichment)

---

### **Step 3: Generate or Collect Sample Log Data**

Created a CSV file `auth_logs.csv` with simulated login attempts, including public IPs for accurate geo-location.

Example entry:

```
2025-05-25 12:00:00,admin,8.8.8.8,Mozilla/5.0,failure,password,
```

---

### **Step 4: Build the ETL Script (`etl_auth_logs.py`)**

* **Extract**: Read the CSV file using `pandas`.
* **Transform**: Clean and prepare the data.
* **Load**: Connect to PostgreSQL using `psycopg2` and insert the data into the `auth_logs` table.

---

### **Step 5: Write Analysis Script (`analyze_auth_logs.py`)**

* Query failed login attempts from PostgreSQL.
* Group by IP and time window to detect brute-force attacks.
* Generate a **bar chart** with `matplotlib`.
* Use `folium` + `ip-api.com` to geolocate IPs and generate `attackers_map.html`.

---

### **Step 6: Automate Report Emailing**

* Used `smtplib` and `email.message` in Python to send a daily email.
* Attached:

  * `Figure_1.png` (chart of failed login IPs)
  * `attackers_map.html` (geo-map)
* Sent using a **Gmail App Password** for security.

---

### **Step 7: Schedule Daily Report**

* Created a `.bat` file to automate script execution.
* Used **Windows Task Scheduler** to run the script daily at a specified time.

---

### **Step 8: Document the Project**

* Created a detailed `README.md` with:

  * Project overview
  * Features
  * Technologies used
  * How to run the project
* Added screenshots and a project architecture diagram
* Compiled a final PDF report for submission

---

### **Step 9: Final Output**

* ✅ ETL and analysis pipeline fully functional
* ✅ Charts and geo-map created successfully
* ✅ Email automation working
* ✅ Project well documented and ready for presentation
